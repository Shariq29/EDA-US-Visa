# 🇺🇸 EDA on US Visa Applications Data

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on US Visa application data to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors influencing visa approval decisions.  
The analysis provides insights into how variables such as **employer**, **job title**, **salary**, **worksite**, and **case status** relate to visa outcomes.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The US visa process involves evaluating thousands of applications across various industries and job roles.  
Through this project, data is explored and visualized to identify factors that affect visa approvals and denials — supporting both **policy analysis** and **immigration research**.

## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Case Status Trends:** Majority of cases fall under “Certified” status, while “Denied” and “Withdrawn” are relatively fewer.  
2. **Top Employers:** Large tech firms (e.g., Infosys, TCS, Deloitte) have the highest number of applications.  
3. **Job Roles:** Software-related roles dominate visa applications.  
4. **Location Analysis:** Most applications come from major tech hubs such as California, Texas, and New York.  
5. **Wage Patterns:** Higher wages generally correlate with higher chances of certification.
